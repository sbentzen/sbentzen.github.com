			Hello, my name is Shaun Bentzen, I'm a third year student in the Computer Engineering Program at Cambrian College. I am an iPhone/iPad and Web developer, and a scripting enthusiast. My blog can be reached <a href="blog.html">here</a>. I am on Twitter, Linkedin, Facebook, Github and a lot of other forums and sites, to which I mostly go by the handle of sbentzen. I have two certifications from Apple and I am working on getting my CCNA, CCNA-S and CCNP and considering MCITP certifications.
