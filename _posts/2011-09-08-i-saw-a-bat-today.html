I saw a bat today, I was on the fourth floor at the college, sitting on a bench and out of the blue I saw this tiny black thing crawling across the wall, so I looked at it and took some pictures. I find it cute.<a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/15585118/Blog%20Photos/Photo-11-09-08-8-32-07-AM-e1315523567914.jpeg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-164" title="Photo 11-09-08 8 32 07 AM" src="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/15585118/Blog%20Photos/Photo-11-09-08-8-32-07-AM-e1315523567914.jpeg" alt="" width="720" height="960" /></a>
