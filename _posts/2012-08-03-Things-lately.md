Holy smokes, been a while since I last posted hasn't it? Anyways, couple of things happened lately, I got a new chair, which is freaking awesome (GO HERMAN MILLER!!)

Furthermore, I am moving back to Ottawa, and hopefully will find a job before I get there.

Things are going well with work, and I've been able to get back into programming a bit (through work) and hopefully I'll be able to do it for fun again.
