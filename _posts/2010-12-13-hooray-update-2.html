Hello everyone,<br/>
<br/>
It has been a while, has it? I don't really know but either way, I'm writing.<br/>
I'm almost finished all of my classes for this semester, and that's good, just need to finish my psychology course and then free sailing from there.<br/>
<br/>
So that means that I've finished another windows course and I also managed to finish my WAN and LAN Switching and Wireless course, which gives me a voucher for my CCNA exam, I think that saves about three hundred dollars?<br/>
<br/>
Did I ever mention that I hate certificates? Cause man are those a pain in the arse for IIS and windows stuff, I mean sure, they give certificates out easy, they make issuing and revoking and enrollment easy, but revocation lists didn't want to work, I kept the bindings and everything and NOPE no revoked certs for you. Oh well.<br/>
<br/>
I'm looking to learn how to play the cello, if someone would be so kind as to point to a good website (not that I can't find them myself) I'd just prefer if someone who's had good experience with a tutorial site would be so kind as to clue me in.<br/>
<br/>
I'm hoping to maybe post some game reviews and tutorials and stuff when I get a new xbox and when I find something that I could post tutorials about.<br/>
<br/>
Anyways, thanks for reading.<br/>
<br/>
Shaun.
