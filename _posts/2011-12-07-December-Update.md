Well, it's been a while since I've last posted an update about anything and that's with due reasonâ€¦ I've moved my blog to [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll), though I have yet to move the Wordpress site into oblivion. I have also been very busy with assignments that have been coming up as of late, just had to do a couple of reports, some presentations and a practical case study, which wasn't that bad actually.  Group policy is actually pretty nice when it works, but, accidentally locking yourself out of your own server through local logon policy sucks, had to install the RSAT tools on a client machine to finish the rest of the work I had to do, and then fix the mistake I made.  

I have also been playing a good chunk of Skyrim, finished the main quest, won't give any spoilers but I must say it was quite fun, especially the killing the dragons part. you see, he was once a dragon, but then he took an arrow to the knee. I should probably get back into Starcraft, I've got an ever growing bonus pool that I need to get rid of, along with keeping whatever skills in the game fresh. I haven't been playing much minecraft though, which is quite unfortunate as I would like to get some of my buildings finished. Furthermore, if I manage to get some free time and some equipment, I may end up hosting my own minecraft server, for a few people, as I don't think I'd want it to be open to everyone.  

School has been going very well, aside from all of the reports and assignments and presentations, I have been learning quite a lot around Microsoft Windows Server '08 R2, Cisco Security, Firewalls along with a bunch of other cool things like NPS, which lets you do AAA authentication on Cisco Devices, which is easily done through some tutorials on the web. I also liked my business course, it was really helpful in my own adventures in being a sole proprietor.  

Anyways, I think that's enough writing for now, I'll probably re-jig this again to make it even prettier
