Well, it's the holiday season, and I wanted to post an update. I managed to land a 4.0 GPA for this semester and I'm so happy that the semester is over, I'm also really excited for this upcoming semester. I have a troubleshooting course, some security courses and a placement for this upcoming semester. I should probably get onto some of the Lion courses, but I haven't had the time to purchase the books, I'll hopefully get that done over this break, I will have enough time to go through them.  

I also bought [Bucky Balls](http://www.thinkgeek.com/geektoys/science/bbe8/), these things are addictively fun. Getting them back into the cube shape however is not, I haven't done that yet, but it won't be too much longer before I am able to reconstruct them into that shape. I have managed to make them into some pretty cool shapes however.



This is what it looked like outside last night...
