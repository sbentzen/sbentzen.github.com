Holy smokes has it been one heck of a week. I've had many assignments, work, and various other things to do. I also would like to apologize to my english teacher, I'm sorry I can't cut my report down to 4 pages from 11. There is just too much content to be covered and too many restrictions <code> :( </code>.

On the plus side, I think I've figured out how to do split-dns properly and hopefully this means I can make my life much easier, HOORAY Forefront Threat Management Gateway curriculum for showing me something that may be useful!

Onto other notes, I managed to fix a problem that I had with my server. I noticed that I accidentally enabled a forward proxy, bad on me for doing that, gave me one hell of a scare. Luckily there are some really good support forums out there and I ended up figuring out that I had the proxy enabled and I turned it off. 

I think I may also get some more time to do some studying into the Lion re-certification that I really should do, along with the keystone journal, the workplace manual, the customer service manual, various oral presentations, and finally a couple reports. I'm also thinking of adding my r&eacute;sum&eacute; to this site, probably after I get some professional photography done, don't want to look like a shmuck to potential employers, co-workers, followers, co-contributers, etc.
