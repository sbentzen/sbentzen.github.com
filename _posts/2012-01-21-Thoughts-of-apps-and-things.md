Well, another week has passed and things seem to be going well, homework is getting done, code is being written and new programming languages being learned. I just recently pushed out a repo for the definitions and macros that I commonly use in my iOS projects to make things easier. I plan to add more when I get into other languages or find other things that I can make into a macro or static definition. The repository can be found [here](https://github.com/sbentzen/Defines-and-Macros), send me a [pull request](https://github.com/sbentzen/Defines-and-Macros/pull/new/master) if you want to share some of your ways of making coding easier.  

On a semi-relevant note, I'm thinking of writing a book about Git with iBooks Author just for the fun of it. This however does not mean that I am an authority on Git or have a complete working knowledge of what it can do. I think it will just be centered around what to do for beginners and some of the best practices that they can get into to do work in an efficient manner.  

The last thing I'm going to mention, is something that I saw on [Picky Palate](http://picky-palate.com) which was their [Cookies and Cream Peanut Butter](http://picky-palate.com/2011/03/10/cookies-and-cream-peanut-butter-midnight-snack/). Holy bananas on a pancake does that ever look good. This is definitely something that I'm going to make in the near future.
