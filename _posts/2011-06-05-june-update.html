Long time no post. Just wanted to get something out there and get an update as to what I'm doing. I've been playing a good amount of Starcraft 2 (is anyone else psyched for Heart of the Swarm?). I've also been working (the 1.2 update to iCambrian has been released) and we've got good download numbers and I've managed to make a good amount of fixes to some issues I've heard about. I'm now working on Version 2.0 and another app. I think I'm going to post some of my extensions onto Github and see what other development I can help with.

I've been trying to get some cello practice in, and it seems to be going well… haven't got to sheet music yet (still learning what sounds and feels right) and how to properly draw the bow.
