Well has it ever been a while since I've posted. A couple of things have happened lately too. In this last while I've managed to
1. Finish my placement
2. Compete in the ontario technological skills competition, I didn't do that well but it was a very fun competition 
3. Graduate from college with an approximate ~4.0 GPA
4. Had my contract extended to do some more iOS development. 

Though, I still need to make long term plans, but those are in the works.  

In the news of video games I've played… not much really. Other than hearing about elder scrolls online and dawnguard… which both look really really cool. I am also pretty psyched for the yet to be dated ME3 Extended cut.
