I predict that within the next 50 to 75 years, we’ll have or will be colonizing the moon, to then move onto mars. I say this because of the curiosity lab rover, and a TED talk that I saw (link [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdbJP8Gxqog&feature=player_embedded)). It makes the utmost sense when you view them together with the
SpaceX missions.

Can you _imagine_ it? People like yourself and I may one day be able to live on the moon, or mars. And if not myself, then certainly my grandchildren or children. This certainly hinges on space programs, and it is of my utmost hope that the US doesn’t cancel theirs, and provides more funding than it currently has.
