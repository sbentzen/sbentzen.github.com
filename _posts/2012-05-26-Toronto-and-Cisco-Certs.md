Well, I went to Toronto from Sunday to Wednesday this week, visiting my cousins and celebrating Victoria day and those sort of things (of which there is a carousel of those images above). I also took my CCNA Composite certificate exam, which hopefully went well.

One of the more interesting photos in the bunch is the one in the subway. Most of the time, subways are broken up into cars and thus you can't go between them. This subway (perhaps just this train) is newer and uses an articulating joint to allow the whole train to be a single compartment, which let you see down the entire train which provides an interesting photo.

The only other photo is the banana phone, everyone loves the banana phone.

Unfortunately, I didn't notice that there was a piece of plastic film on my lens until today… it was giving the photos that glarey effect, which is entirely unintended.
