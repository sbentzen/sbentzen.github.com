Just finished visiting my family over the family day weekend, it was a good visit and we celebrated at least four birthdays. I also managed to get free data from [koodo](http://koodomobile.ca) for a month, which I'm going to use the opportunity to see how much data I would use and then guage on whether it's worth getting a data plan or not.

I've also got a dry run for a case study in my firewall course tomorrow which is what forced me to come back home earlier than I would have wished, but that's life. I've also got some iPods to deployâ€¦ hopefully that won't take too long. Got a whole bunch of things to do too, I also just heard that the things cloud solution just went into a public beta, hopefully they let me import my tasks before too long and be able to sync like that.
