So, It's coming to time to do case studies and final assignments. The TMG assignment is not as bad as I had originally thought it would be, Just have to publish a bunch of services and add in some policies. The setup of the final case looks to be more involved than what the rest of it is going to be. I've already got most of that done though. I don't think there is a final case for my Cisco TSHOOT course, but that's alright, I've done the labs for them and I'm also thinking of doing the labs that aren't required.  

My English and customer service courses are going swell, not too many assignments left, just a couple of tests and assignments. I'm writing a user manual for git for the English assignment, which I may post if I do well enough.  

Onto news other than school, Last night I watched pulp fiction.

Amazing movie, I'm surprised I've never watched it before. If anyone has any movie recommendations just mention @smbentzen in a tweet about a movie and I may watch it (no movies like human centipede please). I spent a good time this week fiddling with some of the stuff on my blog, the only good change was changing the background from an image to a solid colour (wasn't that much of a change anyways).  

I also just recently remembered that Mass Effect 3 is coming out soon, oh boy oberto, I'm going to be spending a good amount of time playing that one, and after that I think it's right back to skyrim, starcraft 2, and diablo 3. I think I may post some more programming stuff when I get back into the groove for writing about it, I've been doing a lot of beta testing lately.  
  
Oh, and as a final note, here's some good [music](http://soundcloud.com/bassnectar).
