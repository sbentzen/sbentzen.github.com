Well, Yesterday was my [birthday](/2012/02/03/Happy-Birthday-to-Me.html) and I had quite a fun time, didn't quite like how I got repeatedly owned in Call of Duty, but that comes with not playing first person shooters in a couple of months. Other than that, I played some Diablo 3, it's pretty awesome. I would say more, but seeing as it's a closed beta I don't think I should say more than I already have. If any of the people who read this want to play with me (I'm pretty sure I suck) my battle tag is **domain#1979**.  

Onto other news, there is no other news.
