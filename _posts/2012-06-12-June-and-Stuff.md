Well, this has been an interesting beginning to the month so far, even though it's not really the beginning of the month. So many cool things lately, like iOS6, Mountain Lion, that new Macbook Pro that I totally want, but can't afford at the moment… and things like buying Diablo 3, which is really fun. Overall I'm having a pretty good time, except for the paperwork I'm doing, which… well… it's paperwork. This is just going to be a really short update cause I'm über busy and don't actually have much to say.
