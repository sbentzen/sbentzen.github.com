Man oh man are things getting busy again, I've got some tests, assignments and other stuff to do. Work is going well and I hope to do some fun stuff with IOS5 and its new features. Starcraft 2 is going pretty well, The leagues are locked and I've stayed in the same relative position for this whole season and hopefully I'll be able to get to gold for the next season. I'm also watching MLG at the moment and it's actually so scintillating that I'm drawn in with a want to play.<br/>
<br/>
That's all I can post about at the moment as there's not really anything new going on this week.
