Happy New Years everyone, we're coming up on the year of 2012, and I just wanted to post greetings to everyone. Hopefully everyone has some good ideas as to what they want to do tonight.  

Looking at the upcoming semester I'll be surprised if I can manage weekly/informative/fun posts, but I will try my best. I'm looking forward to my placement for the upcoming semester and hopefully learn lots about my job choices.  

Not much more I can write about at the moment, other than how much fun I've had in Skyrim in the past few weeks, managed to get a couple of the daedric artifacts, the ebony mail is awesome! I also managed to get up to about level 41 and still climbing, I much prefer this leveling system over the one that was in Oblivion, where I had to pick a couple of skills and the strength of the character was based off of those skills being leveled. Hopefully more minecraft to come and I definitely want to get back into laddering on Starcraft 2 I've been slacking a bit in that area, then again it's hard to do almost anything with this long of a break. The less I do, the less I want to do I suppose?
