Hello again,
<br/>
In the past few weeks many a things have happened.<br/>
I have made it past the first round of the <a href="http://www.academynetriders.com/index.php">Cisco NetRiders</a> competition into the second round, which means that my teammate and I are one of the top ten in Ontario (in the competition). Along with that, school is going well, marks are stable, classes interesting and thought provoking and assignments are both a plenty and workable.<br/>

Work has been going well, the code is flowing in both appropriate and speedy fashion, sometimes when I don't want it to (gah, stop interrupting sleep) but all is well in that sense.<br/>

By the way, are there any good one column, dark word press layouts?<br/>
<br/>
From the world of code,
<br/>
Shaun B.
