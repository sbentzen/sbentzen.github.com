Well, I recently got a new messenger bag from [Timbuk2](http://timbuk2.com) and I already absolutely love it! and furthermore, what the heck, it's a Tuesday and i'm updating? oh well. Below is a photo of the bag (Black and Orange).

In an almost mid-week update, school is going well, just got a lot of assignments and reports due relatively soon.
