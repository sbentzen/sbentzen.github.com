Well, reading week is now on the cusp of the week and I must say that Iâ€™m more than ready for it. Bring on the homework, bring on the assignments, bring on getting my brain back. On the plus side, this also means more time for minecraft, starcraft, diablo, and skyrim. Maybe even some stuff on some programming or other topics like forefront or something. Unfortunately, I also happen to be in "le sick mode" :( which I hope will go away quickly enough.
